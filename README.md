## Algorithms and HackerRank solutions written with Javascript ES6

Some useful algorithms, most of them used by the big guys (Google, Amazon, Facebook) on their interview process.

- [ ] Find the nth element in a Fibonacci series.
- [ ] Given an array of numbers an a target value, find the 2 element that can sum the target value.
- [ ] Given a sequence of numbers find out the odd number - OddManOut.
- [ ] Compress and Decompress an string - Run Length.
- [ ] Binary Search.
- [ ] Binary Search Tree (creation, validation, inOrder, Transversal).
- [ ] Prefix Trees akka Tries.
- [ ] Shuffle an Array - Deck Game.
- [ ] Permutations - Lock Permutations
- [ ] Loops - Stair Case
- [ ] Array Rotation
- [ ] Lost Number

### Do you need new algorithms or solutions?  

If you want an specific solution, please raise an issue.

### Do you want to contribute? create a PR

If you have a different approach or a better performance solution, the only constrain is that must be Javascript ES6 or newer.
